**Lab #1: Basic SSRF against the local server**

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

Browse to /admin and observe that you can't directly access the admin page.
Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
Change the URL in the stockApi parameter to http://localhost/admin. This should display the administration interface.
Read the HTML to identify the URL to delete the target user, which is:

http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos
Submit this URL in the stockApi parameter, to deliver the SSRF attack.

**Lab #2: Basic SSRF against another back-end system**

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal 192.168.0.X range for an admin interface on port 8080, then use it to delete the user carlos.

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Intruder.
Click "Clear ยง", change the stockApi parameter to http://192.168.0.1:8080/admin then highlight the final octet of the IP address (the number 1), click "Add ยง".
Switch to the Payloads tab, change the payload type to Numbers, and enter 1, 255, and 1 in the "From" and "To" and "Step" boxes respectively.
Click "Start attack".
Click on the "Status" column to sort it by status code ascending. You should see a single entry with a status of 200, showing an admin interface.
Click on this request, send it to Burp Repeater, and change the path in the stockApi to: /admin/delete?username=carlos

**Lab #3: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter**

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
Change the URL in the stockApi parameter to http://127.0.0.1/ and observe that the request is blocked.
Bypass the block by changing the URL to: http://127.1/
Change the URL to http://127.1/admin and observe that the URL is blocked again.
Obfuscate the "a" by double-URL encoding it to %2561 to access the admin interface and delete the target user.

**Lab #4:  SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability**

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
Try tampering with the stockApi parameter and observe that it isn't possible to make the server issue the request directly to a different host.
Click "next product" and observe that the path parameter is placed into the Location header of a redirection response, resulting in an open redirection.
Create a URL that exploits the open redirection vulnerability, and redirects to the admin interface, and feed this into the stockApi parameter on the stock checker:

/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin
Observe that the stock checker follows the redirection and shows you the admin page.
Amend the path to delete the target user:

/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos
This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin and delete the user carlos.

The stock checker has been restricted to only access the local application, so you will need to find an open redirect affecting the application first.

**Lab #5: Blind SSRF with out-of-band detection**

This site uses analytics software which fetches the URL specified in the Referer header when a product page is loaded.

To solve the lab, use this functionality to cause an HTTP request to the public Burp Collaborator server.

Visit a product, intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
Go to the Repeater tab. Select the Referer header, right-click and select "Insert Collaborator Payload" to replace the original domain with a Burp Collaborator generated domain. Send the request.
Go to the Collaborator tab, and click "Poll now". If you don't see any interactions listed, wait a few seconds and try again, since the server-side command is executed asynchronously.
You should see some DNS and HTTP interactions that were initiated by the application as the result of your payload.


**Lab #6: SSRF with whitelist-based input filter**

This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

The developer has deployed an anti-SSRF defense you will need to bypass.

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
Change the URL in the stockApi parameter to http://127.0.0.1/ and observe that the application is parsing the URL, extracting the hostname, and validating it against a whitelist.
Change the URL to http://username@stock.weliketoshop.net/ and observe that this is accepted, indicating that the URL parser supports embedded credentials.
Append a # to the username and observe that the URL is now rejected.
Double-URL encode the # to %2523 and observe the extremely suspicious "Internal Server Error" response, indicating that the server may have attempted to connect to "username".
To access the admin interface and delete the target user, change the URL to:

http://localhost:80%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/ad
